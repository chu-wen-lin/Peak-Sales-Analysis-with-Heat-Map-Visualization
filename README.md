### Based on historical data, when are users most active throughout the year and within a day? 

## Goal
Launch promotions during these high-activity periods to stimulate course purchases on the platform.

## Thought Process

   Push ads intensively during peak browsing hours. <br>
   → Not discussed here due to the lack of browsing data.

2. #### High-frequency transaction periods
   Analyze periods with frequent order transactions and treat them as times when users have a higher purchase intent. Marketing campaigns are expected to be most effective when launched during these periods.
   - **Mid-term**: Key months or holidays within a year (e.g., back-to-school season, summer/winter breaks)
   - **Short-term**: Key periods within a week or a day (e.g., typical online activity times of office workers and college students)
